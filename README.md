# Discrete Fourier Transform Vs Fast Fourier Transform

Here I have done a Discrete fourier and Fast Fourier Implementation 

A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a sequence of values into components of different frequencies. The Discrete Fourier Transform can be written as follows :
